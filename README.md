# Burn

## Project Description
Deflationary Token (DFT) is a Solidity-based token with a **2% burn-on-transfer** mechanism, reducing total supply with every transaction. It includes essential ERC-20 functions while ensuring scarcity-driven tokenomics for long-term value.

## Smart Contract Address
`0x8284397DD8A71583A917c7de3Ce9337CA3E0D05a`

## Features
- **Automatic Burn:** 2% of each transaction is burned forever.
- **Scarcity-Driven Tokenomics:** Ensures long-term value by reducing supply.
- **Essential ERC-20 Functions:** Includes transfer, approve, and transferFrom.

## How to Use
1. Add the token to your wallet using the smart contract address.
2. Transfer tokens as usualâ€”2% will be burned automatically.
3. Check your balance and total supply decrease over time.
